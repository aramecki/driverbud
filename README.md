# DriverBud

This repo contains the code of DriverBud, the second edition of MyCarGenie.
With second edition I mean a completely rewritten app on a different framework (Flutter) and with many new features.

# What does this app?
The main aim of DriverBud is to provide a complete diary to manage vehicles in an ordered, complete and useful way.
When a vehicle requires maintenance, mechanics often ask very specific questions, and it is easy to forget about which repairs or changes were made in the past. It is also easy to lose track of the fuel expenses over time or to forget to pay your insurance due or car tax. DriverBud is here to solve all these issues.

# The "WWW"
## Why re-develop your app?
The first version of DriverBud was firstly coded and published in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose and released for Android only.
The app is now being fully re-developed with the Flutter framework with the objective to be:
* Multi-platform-ready,
* Implement new features,
* Get an identity via custom themes.

You can check the first version, MyCarGenie, [here](https://github.com/aramecki/mycargenie).

## When will the app be released?
Currently in the middle of Feb 2026 the app is in middle stages. I decided to make the code public so it could provide something to work-on to alpha testers and for anyone who wants to help me test what is already coded. I think I managed to fix the biggest bugs. I can't say the code is bug free or perfect, still a lot has to be optimized and refactored or generalized, but we know that the code has to be broken by users to check where the most insidious bugs are hidden.
So, I hope to be able to release the app on stores by Spring 2026, but I can't give a sure date because it is being developed in my free time.

## Where will it be published?
DriverBud will definitely be published on the PlayStore. The code is being written and tested for both Android and iOS, but App Store fees makes difficult for an open source app to be published without some dedicated funding. Therefore, iOS users will always need to build the app from source themselves. Android users, on the other hand, will be able to download the APK as soon as the first beta is ready.
