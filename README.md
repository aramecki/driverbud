# MyCarGenie2

This repo contains the code of the second edition of MyCarGenie app

# The "WWW"
## Why the 2?
This is second edition of MyCarGenie app, coded and published before in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose.
The app is currently being fully re-developed with the Flutter framework with the objective to be:
* Multi-platform-ready
* Implement new features
* Get some personality via custom themes

You can check the old version [here](https://github.com/aramecki/my-car-genie).

## When will the app be released?
Currently in the middle of Nov 2025 the app is in early stages. I decided to make the code public after it could provide something to work-on to alpha testers and for anyone who wants to help me test what is already coded. I managed to fix the biggest bugs. I can't say the code is bug free, but we know that the code has to be broken by the users to see where the most insidious bugs are hidden.
So, I hope to be able to release the app by the end of 2025, but I can't give a sure date because it is being developed in my free time.

## Where will it be published?
MyCarGenie2(Probably this won't be the name of the final app) will be published to PlayStore for sure. I'm thinking about pushing it to App Store store too. But, even if the current code works perfectly with both Android and iOS, Apple users will be always required to build the app by themselves until the eventual publication on the store. Android users will receive the first apk release when the first beta will be ready.
